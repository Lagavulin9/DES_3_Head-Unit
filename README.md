## Introduction
This project is part of the [embedded software development cirriculum at SEA-ME](https://github.com/SEA-ME/DES_Head-Unit). <br>

It aims to develop a **Head Unit application** running on a ECU alongside the a **Instrument Cluster application** in Flutter. <br> 
The Head Unit application will provide features like **ambient lighting, gear selection, and a media app**. <br> 
Furthermore, the project uses **Scalable Service-Oriented Middleware (vSOME/IP)** for the in-vehicle communication and **Yocto as the build system** for the ECU. <br>

## Architecture
The following image gives a brief overview about the [software structure](/documentation/software_structure.md) that runs on the cars' [system structure](/documentation/system_structure.md). <br>
Each application like [head-unit](/documentation/headunit.md), [dashboard](/documentation/dashboard.md), [can_receiver](/documentation/can_receiver.md), [car_control](/documentation/car_control.md), and [car_info](/documentation/car_info.md) serves a different purpose and uses different peripheral interfaces and devices. <br> 
BMWs' [CommonAPI](/documentation/common_api.md) ensure the communication between the applications via Scalable Service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP). It is easy to add more apps to the system by using the [CI/CD workflows for CommonAPI](/documentation/workflows.md) we build. <br>
In the current setup, the [speed sensor](/documentation/rpm_speedsensor.md) is the only sensor that feeds the cars' [CAN bus](/documentation/can_bus.md) but it can seamlessly be extended by adding more sensors to the CAN bus. <br>
The system operates with a custom-made [Yocto Image](/DES_3_Head-Unit/documentation/yocto.md) deployed on the Raspberry Pi ECUs.

## Project Structure

The following image shows the project structure for the DES3 Head-Unit project. <br>
- `apps`: contains submodules which hold the source code to run the car. <br> 
- `sensors`: contains submodules for the sensors' controllers that feed vehicle CAN bus. <br>
- `image`: contains a submodule that provides config files and recipes to bitbake the vehicles' ECU yocto image. _(Note: The bitbake recipes are fetching the apps' source code from the submodules' repositories.)_<br>
- `documentation`: summarizes all the projects' documentation. <br>

To roll out the software, the sensors' controller and the ECU needs to be flashed. <br> 

- `sensors` 
  - Clone DES_3_Head-Unit repository. <br>
  - Choose the sensors' directory from the sensors folder. <br>
  - Flash the sensors' controller using the Arduino IDE. <br>

- `image`
  - Clone DES_3_yocto repository. <br>
  - Bitbake the yocto image. <br>
  - Flash the yocto image on the ECU by loading the it on the RPis' SD-Card. <br>

> _The development in each submodule is done individually by the assigned developer. <br>
Once a feature is ready, a new release following the teams' [conventions](/documentation/project_conventions.md) is published._ <br>
